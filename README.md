  My website  üñ•Ô∏è
</h1>
My personal website serves as my developer portfolio, showcasing my projects, bio, and providing a convenient way to get in touch with me. Built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/), and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), the website embodies a minimalistic design approach. The color scheme predominantly features black and white, with tasteful red accents that add a touch of vibrancy.

## Overview
At the core of this website is the belief that simplicity and elegance can create a powerful user experience. The minimalistic design allows the focus to be on the content, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate through my projects, learn about my background, and reach out to me. The central rotating moon on the homepage symbolizes the constant evolution and growth that I strive for as a developer.

The entire website is based on the SPA concept. Through the three main sections - "About," "Projects," and "Contact" - I aim to provide visitors with a holistic understanding of who I am as a developer and how I can contribute to their projects. 

In the "About" section, you will find a detailed biography where I share my journey, skills, and passion for development. This section serves as an introduction, allowing you to get to know me on a personal and professional level.

The "Projects" section is where I showcase my past and ongoing projects. By exploring this section, you can gain insights into my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.

Lastly, the "Contact" section provides a convenient way for potential collaborators, clients, and employers to reach out to me. A user-friendly form is available, allowing you to send me a message directly. I value open and transparent communication, and I'm excited to engage with fellow developers, clients, and potential collaborators.
